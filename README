# JIRA notloggedin plugin

## Running in the development environment

Clone this repo to the same place as the JIRA installation, e.g.,

    atlas/
      - amps-standalone/
          - ...
      - notloggedin-jira-plugin/
          - ...

You can then `cd` into the clone and run it, after first pulling in
the renderer jar,

    cd notloggedin-jira-plugin
    atlas-run

## Packaging

    atlas-mvn package

The plugin is now available at `target/notloggedin-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
